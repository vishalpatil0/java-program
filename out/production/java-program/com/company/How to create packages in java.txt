1) Packages is nothing but a folder of group of java classes.

2)
    first write package package_name as follow

    package package_name;
    
    class class_name{
        method_datatype method_name(){
            //body of method
        }
    }


    Means: the class class_name is a part of package package_name

3) There are two ways to create custom package

    a) Manually - means you have to create a folder of package name and put the classes in it.

    b) javac -d directory_name source_file.java

        you just have to compile the class class_name 
        with this command

        e.g.:= javac -d . class_name.java

        here . id referred as directory_name.

3)while importing 

    like this import com.abc.*;

    make sure that class_name.java (source file) must be present in it with .class file.
