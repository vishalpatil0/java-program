IMP:
    #Java is hybrid language compiled and interpreted
    #javac use compilation
    # java use for interpretation
    
1. Naming Conventions
    a)Class name follows "Pascal Convention" means all first letter of each word are capital.
    b)Function name follows "Camelcase Convention" means except the first letter of first world all other first letter of each words are capital.

2. Data Types
    #Java is STATICALLY TYPED LANGUAGE means you have to mention the type of variable before declaring it.
    a) Primitive data types are intrinsive.
    b) Non-primitve data type are derived.

    1) Byte
        --> Default value is 0.
        --> Takes 1 byte.
        --> Ranges from -128 to 127.
        --> how -128 to 127?
            = it took 1 byte so convert it into bit by multiplying 8 = 1*8 = 8 bits
            = now bit to decimal conversion method 
            = -(2^8)/2 to ((2^8)/2)-1
            = basic explanation is that in 1 byte of storage which is 8 bit of storage we can store number(decimal) from 0 to 255 and to store number more than that we need extra bit.
            = so either we can store 0 to 255 or -127 to 128.

    2) Short
        --> Value range from -(2^16)/2 to (2^16)/2-1
        --> Takes 2 bytes
        --> Default value is 0
    
    3)  Integer
        --> Value ranges from -(2^32)/2 to (2^32)/2-1
        --> Takes 4 bytes
        --> Defualt value is 0.

    4) Float
        --> Takes 4 bytes
        --> Default value is 0.0f

    5) Long
        --> Takes 8 bytes
        --> Value ranges from -(2^64)/2 to (2^64)/2-1
        --> Default value is 0
    
    6) Double
        --> Takes 8 bytes.
        --> Default value is 0.0d.

    7) Char 
        --> Value ranges from 0 to (2^16)-1.
        --> Takes 2 bytes.
        --> Defualt value is '/0000'
    
    8) Boolean
        --> Value is true or false
        --> Size depends on JVM
        --> Defualt value is false.
        
3. Strig is a class in java 
    --> String str=new String("Vishal");  //one way to declare and define String
    --> String str="Vishal";            //another way to create string.


4. Parent class of pre-defined classes in java is Obejct class.


5. In java there is only one Public class

6. If you have declared a parametric constructor and creating object with no parameter then it will give error becasue a default constructor has to be there for handling object creation with no parameter.

7.
    this -> reference variable of current class
    super -> used to invoke constructor, method, variable of parent class.
    
8. We can create variable of abstract not reference.
    -Abstract Class: atleast one abstract method 
    -normal class don't have abstract method

9. Interface variable are static and final by Defualt [public+static+final]
    -interface have static and default methods 
    by defualt method are = [abstract + public]
    -defualt methods have body in interface and they can be overriden in child class
    -if we add new method in interface then we have to add its implementation in every class where we have implemented the interface
    -but with default mehtod it is not compulsion that class implementing the interface should add it
    -interface don't have protected method and private method have body but public don't have body 
    - defualt method are only allowed in interfaces
    - we can create the reference variable of interface

10. explicit assignment of final varaible is only possible through constructor

11. java can have empty class

12. Demo demo; // this is how we create reference
    new Demo(); //this is how we create object
    object is a instance of a class and stays in heap memory of class
    reference variable points to the address of that object

13. Access Specifier
    # protected can be accessed like public but not outside of the packages
    # default access are only accessible in same package 
        we can't use them in subclass form another package
    # 

14. Thread : -use shared memory
             -faster context switching
             -lightweight
             -2 ways to create
             a)Thread class
             b)Runnable Interface
        
15. Instance variable is a variable which is declared withing class but not in any constructor or method.
    Basically a class level variable

16. java.lang is by default imported package of java.
    it contain System class which helps for System.out.println("");
    you don't need to import it explicity.
    java.lang contain System, String, StringBuffer and many more classes.

17. In java there is no nextChar() method so we use next().CharAt(0) approach to take the first character of the entered string.

18. Access modifier for class in java are -> public, default, abstract and final.

19. You cannot inherit final class or extend it.

17. Maximum string method returns some value in java.

18. In java do not use  == for checking equality of strings use .equals() method.

19. this keyword helps to call the default constructorof that class syntax : this()

20. Instance block execute before constructor everytime object of that class is created.
    Syntax: 
    {//instance block
        //statements
    }

21. Static block doesn't need instantination like instance block it can execute without creating an object.
    Syntax:
    static{
        //static blocks
    }

22. Static import : means you can acces the static variables and static method of imported class without using the classname.

23. We cannot declare class like this class name; (like c++) but we can have empty class 
    -> class name{};

24. Main method is static as interpreter use this method before any objects are created.

25. Types of comments
    a. // single line comment
    b. /* */ multiline comment
    c. /** */ Document comment

26. Smallest individual units of program are called as tokens. 
    Types of tokens:
    a. Reserved keywords
    b. literals
    c. separtors
    d. opertors
    e. identifiers

27. Volatile keywords : 
                        a. Cannot be use with classes or methods, only usable with variables.
                        b. Volatile keyword is used to modify the value of a variable by different threads.
                        c. Need of volatile: 
                        -> assume that two threads are working on the same class. Both threads run on different processors where each thread has its local copy of var. If any thread modifies its value, the change will not reflect in the original one in the main memory. It leads to data inconsistency because the other thread is not aware of the modified value.
                        d. It can be used as an alternative way of achieving synchronization in Java.
                        
28. Integer can store value in octal, decimal and binary format.
        Octal ->  int num = 010; means 8 in decimal
        Note: octal number start with 0 as prefix

        Hexadecimal --> int num = 0xc; means 12
        Note: starts with 0x OR 0X as prefix

        Binary -> int num = 0b11; means 3
        Note: starts with 0b OR 0B as prefix.

        Java also support mantisa e exponent

        0.65e4 means 0.65 * 10^4

29. Vairable denotes the storage location which is used to store data value.

30. Java does not support the concept of unsigned data type.

31. while assigning value to float always make sure that u put f at the end of the constant.
    e.g --> float value = 12.3f;

32. For modulo opertor the sign of the result is always the sign of the first operand.
    e.g. --> -a % b = -c

33. Unlike c & c++ % operator can be applied to floating point as well.
