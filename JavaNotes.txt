1. Naming Conventions
    a)Class name follows "Pascal Convention" means all first letter of each word are capital.
    b)Function name follows "Camelcase Convention" means except the first letter of first world all other first letter of each words are capital.

2. Data Types
    #Java is statically typed language means you have to mention the type of variable before declaring it.
    a) Primitive data types are intrinsive.
    b) Non-primitve data type are derived.

    1) Byte
        --> Default value is 0.
        --> Takes 1 byte.
        --> Ranges from -128 to 127.
        --> how -128 to 127?
            = it took 1 byte so convert it into bit by multiplying 8 = 1*8 = 8 bits
            = now bit to decimal conversion method 
            = -(2^8)/2 to (2^8)/2-1
            = basic explanation is that in 1 byte of storage which is 8 bit of storage we can store number(decimal) from 0 to 255 and to store number more than that we need extra bit.
            = so either we can store 0 to 255 or -127 to 128.

    2) Short
        --> Value range from -(2^16)/2 to (2^16)/2-1
        --> Takes 2 bytes
        --> Default value is 0
    
    3)  Integer
        --> Value ranges from -(2^32)/2 to (2^32)/2-1
        --> Takes 4 bytes
        --> Defualt value is 0.

    4) Float
        --> Takes 4 bytes
        --> Default value is 0.0f

    5) Long
        --> Takes 8 bytes
        --> Value ranges from -(2^64)/2 to (2^64)/2-1
        --> Default value is 0
    
    6) Double
        --> Takes 8 bytes.
        --> Default value is 0.0d.

    7) Char 
        --> Value ranges from 0 to (2^16)-1.
        --> Takes 2 bytes.
        --> Defualt value is '/0000'
    
    8) Boolean
        --> Value is true or false
        --> Size depends on JVM
        --> Defualt value is false.
        
3. Strig is a class in java 
    --> String str=new String("Vishal");  //one way to declare and define String
    --> String str="Vishal";            //another way to create string.
